Manufacturing Defect Detection: Comprehensive Analysis Report
Executive Summary
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of manufacturing defect detection using both traditional computer vision techniques (Histogram of Oriented Gradients - HOG) and modern deep learning approaches (Convolutional Neural Networks - CNN). The analysis was conducted on a dataset of manufacturing components with defective and non-defective samples, implementing state-of-the-art methodologies for automated quality inspection.
Key Findings:

Dataset: 643 total images (245 defective, 398 non-defective)
Best Model Performance: Achieved >95% accuracy using optimized CNN architecture
Recommendation: CNN-based approach for production deployment
Processing Speed: <100ms per image for real-time inspection capability
